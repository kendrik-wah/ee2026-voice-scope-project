# ee2026-voice-scope-project

Using a Basys 3 Artix-7 FPGA Board, my partner and I were assigned to program a Voice Scope, where we could see the volume levels entering the mic.

My partner modified the visual displays on the screen to include ASCII letters.

I focused on making the project a functional usable minimally viable recorder.
It supports recording of noises up to 6 seconds (board limitation), deletion of recordings, record freezing and modified visualization of graphs.
This recorder also supports mic calibration; it allows zeroing of volumes based on surrounding volume levels and account for any difference.
